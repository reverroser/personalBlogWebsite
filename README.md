# Personal Blog Website

This is the first project of the Frontend Development nanodegree from Udacity.

This project was done following the guidlines in the exercise desciption.

## Content

This is a mock project to simulate a blog.

The first page shows a grid of articles. Each article is clickable and redirects you to the single post page.

The single post page is static so the content doesnÂ´t change.
